# Additive-Manufacturing-Error-Correction
The intial printing settings are: temperature, speed. We only focused on these settings because we are trying first to optimize the cross section of every layer, so printing one layer and optimizing that layer.

Later we will push to recording: temperature, speed, layer height, infill, and cooling speeds for broader impact in additive manifacturing. 

This project is to see if we can get any stock mass produced 3D printer to optimize printing quailty in real time or improve quality over iterations of printing.
